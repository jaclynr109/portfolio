				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This figure is depicting growth in covid cases (through a 7 day average of new covid cases) from the start of covid until when the article was published in January 2022</li>
				<li>Even though there was a slowdown in new cases from October-the beginning of December 2021, the number of new cases in the US is greatest in January 2022 (over 300,000) compared to other years (2020 and 2021) </li>
				<li>There is a cyclical nature to the number new covid cases over time</li>
				<li>There was a local peak in new cases in January 2021</li>
				<li>In June 2021, new cases went down to unprecedented low number for the first time since the pandemic started and then rose again in September </li>
				<li>Before March 2020, there were no new covid-19 cases in the United States</li>
				<li>The 7 day average for new covid cases in the US in January has been steadily increasing year after year (from 2020-2022)</li>
				<li>The number of new cases in the US is greater in fall and winter compared to spring and summer</li>
				<li>The average number of new cases rose over 150k for the first time in the US in December 2020</li>
				<li>The peak 7 day average number of new cases before January 2022 was in January 2021</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The spiral visualization is effective when the goal is to emphasize seasonality, cyclical recurrence, and emotional framing. By encoding month as angle, cases as radial distance, and year as spiral progression, the figure highlights familiar winter surges and visually reinforces the idea that “we’ve seen this before.” The minimal labeling and lack of quantitative annotations direct attention toward overall shape rather than precise magnitude, encouraging pattern recognition over numerical comparison. In this sense, the spiral succeeds as a narrative device: it creates a sense of pandemic history and continuity across years while facilitating visual comparisons of the same months across different cycles.

				However, the design also introduces cognitive load and interpretive ambiguity. It may take viewers time to orient themselves to the encoding, and the absence of scale markers, annotations, and contextual references (e.g., variants or vaccination) makes magnitude and policy implications harder to assess. White space between years complicates direct numerical comparison, and the smoothing choice (7-day average) is unexplained for a general audience. While the visual subtly suggests that COVID surges are cyclical and predictable, the article’s argument appears to emphasize that the most recent wave is unusually large and variant-driven. This creates a slight tension: the spiral reinforces recurrence, whereas the text aims to stress difference.

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        DESCRIBE YOUR RATIONALE TO JUSTIFY THE DECISIONS FOR YOUR FINAL DESIGN.
				WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY, AND HOW DOES YOUR DESIGN FACILITATE THIS?
      </p>

			<p>
        REFLECT ON HOW YOUR FINAL DESIGN DOES OR DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE.
				WHAT TENSIONS OR TRADEOFFS DID YOU ENCOUNTER? WHAT DID NOT WORK OUT AS ANTICIPATED?
